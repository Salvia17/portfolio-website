# portfolio-website

## Overview

This was the first project I have built, while taking CareerFoundry web development courses. The objective was to build a 
responsive portfolio website with HTML and CSS that could potentially showcase upcoming projects I'd work on throughout the course.
I have added Bootstrap to this website as well, so I could become more familiar with using it. I have tried to keep the visuals clean. 
I see this as a work still in progress, and will experiment with this website more.
