				<h3>Portfolio Website</h3>
				<p>This is the very same website you are browsing now. This was the first project I had to do
					while taking Web Development course at CareerFoundry. It was built using mostly HTML and CSS, and was
					meant to be as an introduction to Web Development. This website is still being worked on and developed.

				<h3>Movie API</h3>
				<p>The objective of this project was to build the server-side component of a “movies” web application.
					The web application will provide users with access to information about different
					movies, directors, and genres. Users will be able to sign up, update their
					personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies. This the is firts part of the full MERN
					stack
					application called MyFlix, and was created using MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js, Mongoose, Heroku, NPM.

				<h3>Daily Organiser</h3>
				<p>This was a jQuery mini-project, the To-Do-List app, written during CareerFoundry course.
					It's a very basic daily organiser, where user can add a new item to a list of items, cross it out,
					delete it and change the order of items.

				<h3>Pokedex-app</h3>
				<p>This app displays a list of Pokemons, and was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery and Bootstrap.
					The information of Pokemons is fethed from an external API ('https://pokeapi.co'),
					and is displayed in a modal window. Fetched information includes name, height, weight and an image.

				<h3>myFlix-client</h3>
				<p>This is the client-side for an application called myFlix, built using React and is based on its existing
					server-side code (REST API and database).
					The whole myFlix project is built using MERN stack. This web application provides users with the access to
					information about different movies,
					directors and genres. Users are able to sign up, update personal information,
					and create a list of their favorite movies.

				<h3>Meet App</h3>
				<p>This serverless, progressive web application (PWA) is built with React using a test-driven development (TDD)
					technique.
					The application uses the Google Calendar API to fetch upcoming events. It's key features let users
					filter events by city, show/hide event's details and specify the number of events to be displayed. This
					app can be used offline, users can add a shortcut to their screen and see a chart of number of upcoming events
					by city.
